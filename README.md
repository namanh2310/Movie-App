# Movie App

## Introduction

This website application is my self-project created for studying and applying the knowledge that I've learnt about Redux and Redux Toolkit (RTK) ðŸŽˆ\
`Note that: The generated UI is 30% based on Netflix client (Login and Welcome page)`

## Technologies

This project is 100% Frontend technologies: 

&nbsp; â€¢ ReactJS: \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + Axios: for calling movies/series API \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + react-router-dom: for navigating and classifying by URL for the website \
\
&nbsp; â€¢ Redux Toolkit: \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + createAsyncThunk: for calling movies/series API and handling many asynchronous actions \
\
&nbsp; â€¢ Redux Persist: for creating the login/logout functions

## Functions:

Movie App contains many basic functions: \
&nbsp; â€¢ Login/Logout \
&nbsp; â€¢ Search (by name/year) \
&nbsp; â€¢ Change categories (Movies/Series) \
&nbsp; â€¢ Show the movies/series' information (poster, description, title, trailer, ...) \
